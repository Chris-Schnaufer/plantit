Some preliminary notes for workflow developers:

- **PlantIT doesn't care what your workflow looks like**. If it runs in Docker or Singularity, it will run on PlantIT. Use any software stack you like.
- **PlantIT doesn't care what your data looks like**. If it fits in a file or directory on your deployment target, PlantIT will feed it to your workflow.
