### Overview

---

PlantIT has 3 fundamental abstractions: <i class="fas fa-stream fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Workflow**, <i class="fas fa-database fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Dataset**, and <i class="fas fa-terminal fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Run**.

##### <i class="fas fa-stream fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Workflow**

The workflow is PlantIT's unit of work. PlantIT doesn't much care what it looks like. If it will run in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/), it will run on PlantIT.

##### <i class="fas fa-database fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Dataset**

A dataset is a collection of (one or more) files. A workflow may (but need not) accept an input dataset, and may (but, again, need not) produce an output dataset.

##### <i class="fas fa-terminal fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Run**

A run is a single instantiation of a workflow &mdash; a deployment to some HPC cluster, for instance.
