A <i class="fas fa-database fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Dataset** is a folder in the CyVerse data store; whether in the user's personal directory, or in the community `iplant/home/shared/` folder, or in the public data commons.

## Viewing data

To view datasets, navigate to the <i class="fas fa-database fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Datasets** tab from the home view. This will present a page with three (3) tabs:

- `Yours`: your own personal datasets
- `Shared`: datasets other users have shared with you
- `Sharing`: datasets you're sharing with other users
