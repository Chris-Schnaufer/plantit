An <i class="fas fa-server fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Agent** runs <i class="fas fa-tasks fa-1x fa-fw"></i> **Tasks.** Abstractly, an agent is a particular configuration for connecting and submitting to a cluster, supercomputer or server equipped with the SLURM scheduling system. Multiple agents can be configured for the same underlying hardware, e.g. to permit submissions to distinct queues.

## Integrate an agent

Please [contact the `plantit` developers](mailto:wbonelli@uga.edu) if you would like to bind a cluster as a deployment target at your institution.
